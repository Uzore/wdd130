    <p>Glad to know that someone is viewing my web page. I live in Abuja, Nigeria. It is a beautiful place with awesome hilly sceneries and open parks. By the way, and I'm single and you can call me JoE. I'm very optimistic, curious, adventurous and fun
        to be around. <br> I also love traveling, singing off key; like making up my own lyrics of songs that I listen to, and I love productive assets. </p>
    <p>My interest in web development began when I realized the advantages of the internet and how it can positively influence communication, business and almost everything we do.<br>I want to obtain Bachelor's degree in Applied Technology in the next four
        years; I hope we achieve this with you as well. </p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints for more than 10years and I served my full-time mission in West Africa. I really find the principle of personal revelation interesting.</p>
    <p>Presently, I manage a business and intend to build web sites and application softwares even before I graduate Brigham Young University, Idaho. <br>I can't wait to get to know bits about you also, So feel free to share. <br>Thanks for adding me to
        your long list of friends and for viewing my web page.<br>Let's connect on WhatsApp via:+2348060006050 and on linkedin at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joe-nnachi.html"><em>JoE Nnachi</em></a>
